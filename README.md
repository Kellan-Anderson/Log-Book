# Data Tracker App
This app is meant to act as a tool for items that you want to track. Tracking is supported for calories, spending and time management. Your data is important, and thats why we do not store any of the information that you provide to this app. Instead, the device you use keeps track of it for you, syncing your data with the local storage on your device

## Spending tracker
The spending tracker has three main parts: a budget area, a transaction area, and a history area. The budget area is where you can set limits on a per month or per year basis for different categories, such as fast food, groceries, etc. The transactions area is where you can log different transactions to different accounts. When you add a transaction to a budgeted category the corresponding budget area will update automatically. The spending tracker also supports tracking for different accounts. Each account has its own budget categories and transaction logs

## Time Tracker
The time tracker is meant to operate like a clock-in/clock-out system. It has two main parts: an area to create time punches and a history area. The time punch area has different buttons depending on the state of your current time punch. There is an new punch button regardless of the state. The states for the different buttons are as follows:

* **Not clocked in:** A clock in button
* **Clocked in:** A lunch clock out button and a normal clock out button
* **On lunch:** A clock in from lunch button and a clock out button

The history area is where you can view all of the previous time punches you have made. You can filter the time punches based on a start date and an end date. You can also export your time punches to a .csv file. The time tracker area also has the ability to track time for different different projects/jobs by using a dropdown selector at the top of the screen.

## Calories
The calory tracking area can be used to log calories for different foods. There is a log and a history area. The log area has two inputs, one for selecting the food and one for selecting the calories in the food. The history area allows for you to see all of the previous calories you have eaten for a day
