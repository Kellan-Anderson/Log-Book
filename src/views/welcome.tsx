              This app is meant to act as a tool for items that you want to track. Tracking is supported for calories, 
              spending and time management. Your data is important, and thats why we do not store any of the information 
              that you provide to this app. Instead, the device you use keeps track of it for you, syncing your data with 
              the local storage on your device. Check out some of the apps below!
